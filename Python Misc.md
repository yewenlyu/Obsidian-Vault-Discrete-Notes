## Primitive Data Types and Operators

```python
# Floor division rounds towards negative infinity
5 // 3 # => 1
-5 // 3 # => -2
5.0 // 3.0 # => 1.0 # works on floats too
-5.0 // 3.0 # => -2.0
```

```python
# Using boolean logical operators on ints casts them to booleans for evaluation,
# but their non-cast value is returned.
0 and 2   # => False and True => False => 0
0 or -5   # => False and True => True => -5
```

```python
# Comparison chaining
1 < 2 < 3  # => True
2 < 3 < 2  # => False
```

```python
# is vs. ==
# `is` checks if two variables refer to the same object
# but `==` checks if the objects pointed to have the same values.

a = [1, 2, 3, 4] # Point a at a new list, [1, 2, 3, 4]
b = a # Point b at what a is pointing to
b is a # => True, a and b refer to the same object
b == a # => True, a's and b's objects are equal
b = [1, 2, 3, 4] # Point b at a new list, [1, 2, 3, 4]
b is a # => False, a and b do not refer to the same object
b == a # => True, a's and b's objects are equal
```

```python
# Multiline String
s =Â """Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet,  
consectetur adipiscing elit,  
sed do eiusmod tempor incididunt  
ut labore et dolore magna aliqua."""  
print(s) # prints 4 lines
```

```python
# None is an object
# None is not the same as 0, False, or an empty string. None is a data type of its own (NoneType) and only None can be None.
None # => None
```

## Variable and Collections

```python
# By default the print function also prints out a newline at the end.
# Use the optional argument end to change the end string.
print("Hello, World", end="!") # => Hello, World!
```

```python
# Make a one layer deep copy using slices
li2 = li[:]  # => li2 = [1, 2, 4, 3] but (li2 is li) will result in false.
```

```python
# Tuples are created by default if you leave out the parentheses
a, *b, c = 1, 2, 3, 4 # a is now 1, b is now [2, 3] and c is now 4
```

```python
# Note keys for dictionaries have to be immutable types. This is to ensure that
# the key can be converted to a constant hash value for quick look-ups.
# Immutable types include ints, floats, strings, tuples.
invalid_dict = {[1,2,3]: "123"}  # => Yield a TypeError: unhashable type: 'list'
valid_dict = {(1,2,3):[1,2,3]}   # Values can be of any type, however.
```

```python
# The get method supports a default argument when the value is missing
filled_dict.get("one", 4)   # => 1
filled_dict.get("four", 4)  # => 4
```

```python
# "setdefault()" inserts into a dictionary only if the given key isn't present
filled_dict.setdefault("five", 5)  # filled_dict["five"] is set to 5
filled_dict.setdefault("five", 6)  # filled_dict["five"] is still 5
```

```python
# Unpacking for dictionaries
{"a": 1, **{"b": 2}}  # => {'a': 1, 'b': 2}
{"a": 1, **{"a": 2}}  # => {'a': 2}
```

```python
# Do set intersection with &
other_set = {3, 4, 5, 6}
filled_set & other_set  # => {3, 4, 5}

# Do set union with |
filled_set | other_set  # => {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6}

# Do set difference with -
{1, 2, 3, 4} - {2, 3, 5}  # => {1, 4}

# Do set symmetric difference with ^
{1, 2, 3, 4} ^ {2, 3, 5}  # => {1, 4, 5}

# Check if set on the left is a superset of set on the right
{1, 2} >= {1, 2, 3}  # => False

# Check if set on the left is a subset of set on the right
{1, 2} <= {1, 2, 3}  # => True
```

```python
# Make a one layer deep copy for set
filled_set = some_set.copy() # filled_set is {1, 2, 3, 4, 5}
```

## Control Flow and Iterables

```python
"""
Loop over a list to retrieve both the index and the value of each list item:
    0 dog
    1 cat
    2 mouse
"""
animals = ["dog", "cat", "mouse"]
for i, value in enumerate(animals):
    print(i, value)
```

```python
# global scope
x = 5

def set_x(num):
    # local scope begins here
    # local var x not the same as global var x
    x = num    # => 43
    print(x)   # => 43

def set_global_x(num):
    # global indicates that particular var lives in the global scope
    global x
    print(x)   # => 5
    x = num    # global var x is now set to 6
    print(x)   # => 6

set_x(43)
set_global_x(6)
"""
prints:
    43
    5
    6
"""
```

```python
# Closures in nested functions:
# We can use the nonlocal keyword to work with variables in nested scope which shouldn't be declared in the inner functions.
def create_avg():
    total = 0
    count = 0
    def avg(n):
        nonlocal total, count
        total += n
        count += 1
        return total/count
    return avg
avg = create_avg()
avg(3)  # => 3.0
avg(5)  # (3+5)/2 => 4.0
avg(7)  # (8+7)/3 => 5.0
```

```python
# There are also anonymous functions
(lambda x: x > 2)(3)                  # => True
(lambda x, y: x ** 2 + y ** 2)(2, 1)  # => 5
```

```python
# There are built-in higher order functions
list(map(add_10, [1, 2, 3]))          # => [11, 12, 13]
list(map(max, [1, 2, 3], [4, 2, 1]))  # => [4, 2, 3]
list(filter(lambda x: x > 5, [3, 4, 5, 6, 7]))  # => [6, 7]
```

```python
# We can use list comprehensions for nice maps and filters
# List comprehension stores the output as a list (which itself may be nested).
[add_10(i) for i in [1, 2, 3]]         # => [11, 12, 13]
[x for x in [3, 4, 5, 6, 7] if x > 5]  # => [6, 7]

# You can construct set and dict comprehensions as well.
{x for x in "abcddeef" if x not in "abc"}  # => {'d', 'e', 'f'}
{x: x**2 for x in range(5)}  # => {0: 0, 1: 1, 2: 4, 3: 9, 4: 16}
```

## Iterable

```python
# Python offers a fundamental abstraction called the Iterable.
# An iterable is an object that can be treated as a sequence.
# The object returned by the range function, is an iterable.

filled_dict = {"one": 1, "two": 2, "three": 3}
our_iterable = filled_dict.keys()
print(our_iterable)  # => dict_keys(['one', 'two', 'three']). This is an object
                     # that implements our Iterable interface.

# We can loop over it.
for i in our_iterable:
    print(i)  # Prints one, two, three

# However we cannot address elements by index.
our_iterable[1]  # Raises a TypeError
```

## Iterator

```python
# An iterable is an object that knows how to create an iterator.
our_iterator = iter(our_iterable)

# Our iterator is an object that can remember the state as we traverse through
# it. We get the next object with "next()".
next(our_iterator)  # => "one"

# It maintains state as we iterate.
next(our_iterator)  # => "two"
next(our_iterator)  # => "three"

# After the iterator has returned all of its data, it raises a
# StopIteration exception
next(our_iterator)  # Raises StopIteration

# We can also loop over it, in fact, "for" does this implicitly!
our_iterator = iter(our_iterable)
for i in our_iterator:
    print(i)  # Prints one, two, three

# You can grab all the elements of an iterable or iterator by call of list().
list(our_iterable)  # => Returns ["one", "two", "three"]
list(our_iterator)  # => Returns [] because state is saved
```

## Generator

*Main Note: [[Python Generator]]*

```python
# Generators help you make lazy code.
def double_numbers(iterable):
    for i in iterable:
        yield i + i

# Generators are memory-efficient because they only load the data needed to
# process the next value in the iterable. This allows them to perform
# operations on otherwise prohibitively large value ranges.
# NOTE: `range` replaces `xrange` in Python 3.
for i in double_numbers(range(1, 900000000)):  # `range` is a generator.
    print(i)
    if i >= 30:
        break

# Just as you can create a list comprehension, you can create generator
# comprehensions as well.
values = (-x for x in [1,2,3,4,5])
for x in values:
    print(x)  # prints -1 -2 -3 -4 -5 to console/terminal

# You can also cast a generator comprehension directly to a list.
values = (-x for x in [1,2,3,4,5])
gen_to_list = list(values)
print(gen_to_list)  # => [-1, -2, -3, -4, -5]
```

###  Decorator

*Main Note: [[Python Decorator]]*

```python
# Decorators are a form of syntactic sugar.
# They make code easier to read while accomplishing clunky syntax.

# Wrappers are one type of decorator.
# They're really useful for adding logging to existing functions without needing to modify them.

def log_function(func):
    def wrapper(*args, **kwargs):
        print("Entering function", func.__name__)
        result = func(*args, **kwargs)
        print("Exiting function", func.__name__)
        return result
    return wrapper

@log_function               # equivalent:
def my_function(x,y):       # def my_function(x,y):
    return x+y              #   return x+y
                            # my_function = log_function(my_function)
# The decorator @log_function tells us as we begin reading the function definition
# for my_function that this function will be wrapped with log_function.
# When function definitions are long, it can be hard to parse the non-decorated
# assignment at the end of the definition.

my_function(1,2)  # => "Entering function my_function"
                  # => "3"
                  # => "Exiting function my_function"
```

```python
# But there's a problem.
# What happens if we try to get some information about my_function?

print(my_function.__name__)  # => 'wrapper'
print(my_function.__code__.co_argcount)  # => 0. The argcount is 0 because both arguments in wrapper()'s signature are optional.

# Because our decorator is equivalent to my_function = log_function(my_function)
# we've replaced information about my_function with information from wrapper

# Fix this using functools

from functools import wraps

def log_function(func):
    @wraps(func)  # this ensures docstring, function name, arguments list, etc. are all copied
                  # to the wrapped function - instead of being replaced with wrapper's info
    def wrapper(*args, **kwargs):
        print("Entering function", func.__name__)
        result = func(*args, **kwargs)
        print("Exiting function", func.__name__)
        return result
    return wrapper

@log_function
def my_function(x,y):
    return x+y

my_function(1,2)  # => "Entering function my_function"
                  # => "3"
                  # => "Exiting function my_function"

print(my_function.__name__)  # => 'my_function'
print(my_function.__code__.co_argcount)  # => 2
```
